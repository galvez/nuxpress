# The successor, [NuxtPress](https://nuxt.press/) is available now

**The code in this repository should not be used any longer**.

It is in the process of being replaced by an official [Nuxt](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js) module.

This `README` will be updated with details about the module migration once it's released.

The old [`README`](https://github.com/galvez/nuxpress/blob/master/README-archived.md) is still available for reference.
