A noteworthy interchange from the AtomSyntax mailing-list 
and a reminder on IETF's importance for the web.s

# Atom W3C/IETF Discussion

I've been lurking on the [AtomSyntax mailing-list][] for quite some time now, 
and I'm finding the way the project evolves very interesting.

The group has always kept the discussion focused on technical issues and getting
things done, but recently there has been a flurry of talk regarding the decision
of whether to go to the [W3C][] or [IETF][].

Both standards bodies are very receptive. The W3C entered the scene late by 
making an invitation at a rather inconvenient time. The Atom members had just
sent their formal proposal to the IETF. After much talk, and despite the 
[insistence][] of the W3C folks, the IETF [accepted][] the creation of an 
Atom WG. From what I can see, most of the Atom mailing-list active members are 
happy with this, they just want to get back to technical issues as soon as
possible, but there are some people who are still fighting to take the standard
to the W3C. Here's a snippet from the ongoing [discussion]]:

Here's a [response][] from [Joe Gregorio][]:

I've added the links to the IETF specifications Joe cites. I think that for a 
moment in this whole discussion, I had forgotten how great the IETF is. What 
they are responsible for. They're basically responsible for the core standards 
that form the base of what we know as a **internet**. The IETF is a solid, 
strong, and well respected organization, and I just thought I'd share this 
little fact to anyone who's saddened Atom is not going to the W3C anymore.
